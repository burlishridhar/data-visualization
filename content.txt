1. About Me

I enjoy building lean, minimalist and blazing fast web applications. An appreciation for the Japanese principles of Zen coupled with an equally minimalist approach for design has resulted in a constant endeavor to build simple, elegant and ituitive applications. However, I also like to think of myself as a big picture man. Applications rarely stand out on  their own and are almost always embedded in a process which aims to achieve a particular objective. I believe applications should be designed in a manner which simplifies the achievement of this objective.

Anyway, thats enough yakking from me. Reach out to me if you want to discuss code, people and/or books.

I worked with the Indian subsidiary of the largest international credit rating agency. My primary responsibilities included redesigning parts of the existing application architecture and designing modules to implement new features.
I led a team of five developers from two separate locations and managed to beat every deadline we were assigned during my six month tenure.

4. Work Experience - Infosys

I was involved with two major projects for the second largest bank holding company and the largest cable company in the United States respectively.

I also worked directly with the client technical liasons to accurately identify scope and freeze a preliminary set of requirements.
